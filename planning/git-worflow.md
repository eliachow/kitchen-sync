- Master branch is your **production** branch

**NEVER code on Master/Main**
Commit often at each step

$ git checkout main
$ git pull origin main
$ git branch BRANCHNAME
$ git checkout BRANCHNAME
$ git commit -m “”
$ git push -u origin BRANCHNAME
$ git checkout main
Go to github to solve conflicts, pull & merge
Delete branch once merge is successful
