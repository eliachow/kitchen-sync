You need TWO terminal windows to run this project:

In one terminal, cd into `backend`. Run npm install to install the dependencies, then npm start to launch the server (base URL is localhost:8080).
To use custom port, e.g. 8081, please create .env file in backend folder: PORT=8081

In the other terminal, cd into `client`. Run npm install to install the dependencies. Then run npm start, and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
